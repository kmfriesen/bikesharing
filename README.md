# bikesharing

# Overview
This project's objective is to make a business proposal for a bike sharing app in Des Moines, Iowa using NYC Citi Bike dataset to determine if it's a good idea to undertake this project based on a statistical analysis.

Citi Bike's dataset was analysed for the month of August 2019 and produced several graphs that show different metrics of this business.

Tools utilized for this project

- Tableau Public 
- Microsoft Excel
- Pandas

# Results

Using Tableau the following visualizations were created to help investors better understand the bike sharing data collected from August 2019 in NYC. 

# Gender Breakdown Viz
- There was a total of 2,344,224 trips taken
- 1,530,272 (~65%) trips taken by males
- 588,431 (~25%) trips taken by females

# August Peak Hours
- The highest morning ride volume occurred at 8AM.
- The highest afternoon ride volume occurred at 5 and 6 PM.
- This appears to be related to morning and afternoon work commutes.

# Weekday Trips per Hour
- During weekdays, most rides occur at 8AM in the morning and 5PM to 6PM in the afternoon. 
- This appears to be related to morning and afternoon work commutes. 
- During weekends, we see a different story with most rides occurring between 10AM to 6PM.

# Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

- During weekdays, most rides occur at 8AM in the morning and 5PM to 6PM in the afternoon. 
- During weekends, most rides occurring between 10AM to 6PM. 
- The highest volume of rides are by males between 5PM to 6PM on Thursdays.

# Summary

- Most users (~65%) are male subscribers to CitiBike. 
- The average duration of rides are about 5 minutes with females having a slightly longer trip duration per ride then males (6 minutes). 
- Both males and females follow the same trend of most rides occurring at 8AM in the morning and 5PM to 6PM in the afternoon on weekdays which appears to be related to morning and afternoon work commutes. 
- During weekends, most rides occurring between 10AM to 6PM. 
- Thursdays between 5PM to 6PM seem are the most popular day for both males and females.
- The best time of day for bike repairs would be between 2AM to 4AM becausethat's when there is the lowest volume of riders.

- Some additional visualizations that could be helpful would be to break down the peak day of Thursday by area to see if there is a correlation to an event or place on that day that explains the additional volume. Another interesting visualization could be to investigate winter months further to see if there are the same hourly trends and volumes. August is probably a very popular time to be outside in New York City but could be quite different in Decemeber when commuting to and from work would be more challenging by bike because of the colder weather.
